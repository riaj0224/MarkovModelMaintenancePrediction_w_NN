# Predictive Maintenance: Hybrid Markov Model Evaluation 

This repository presents a project which explores the fascinating realm of Predictive Maintenance, an area becoming increasingly critical as industrial machinery and systems advance in complexity. The central objective of this project is to assess the reliability of a hybrid Markov model vs a traditional model, thereby generating valuable insights into optimal strategies for industrial maintenance scheduling.

## :hammer_and_wrench: What's Inside?

This project embraces a comprehensive approach to data analysis, involving several stages:

1. **Data Preprocessing** — Initial data cleaning stage, eliminating potential measurement errors. 
2. **Data Preparation** — Smart distribution of cleaned data for training and testing the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).
3. **MLP Design** — Creation of an MLP with precise error requirements (±3%).
4. **Mathematical Models** — Establishment of an ideal condition Markov model to predict expected outcomes.
5. **Simulation Models** — Implementation of the Markov model in simulation software, comparing classical and hybrid models.
6. **Simulation Results** — Presentation and discussion of results from both models.
7. **Evaluation** — Comprehensive analysis and comparison of the models, deriving insightful conclusions on maintenance timing.

## :computer: Technologies Used

This project leverages multiple technologies:

- DataEngine
- MATLAB
- Excel
- Dynastar

These were utilized to manage and process data, design and train the MLP, simulate the Markov models, and perform final analyses.
